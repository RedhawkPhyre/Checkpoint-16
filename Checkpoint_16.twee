<span class='lia'>The crime member? Are you absolutely sure you should see him?	
He is a dangerous individual. If you’re wrong, this could go badly.</span>

<span class='main-char'>I need to find Mira. I’ll take on any risk and consequence if it means that I can see her again.</span>

//You approached the crime member at the Lounge & Bar and demanded to know where Mira was. They seemed irked by your presence, but oddly compliant towards your request.//

<span class='crime-mem'>Alright, buddy, you wanna know where Mira is? Follow me, I’ll take you to her.</span>

//You followed the suited individual to the half-empty transportation garage. You understand that the chilled night scene is just holograms, yet shivers still run down your spine. The perfectly parked ships are lit by blue moonlight. You grow increasingly apprehensive of mysterious figures as you follow them through the garage, but stay determined to solve the case. Besides, it is far too late to turn back now. //
//They abruptly come to a stop. You fail to notice and walk ahead a few more paces before realizing that they are now behind you. You turn your head, asking where you two are going, and are met with a muzzle pointed straight at your chest.//

<span class='crime-mem'>Those were some serious accusations you were throwing around. Abduction, huh? That could seriously tarnish a reputation. I can’t let that happen to me, and especially not the songbird. Luckily, for you, I have a good idea where this Mira person could be. Why don’t you pay her a visit?</span>

// In an instant, you hear a bang as your vision clouds with red. A shade you’ve seen before… scarlet, much like that of lights at the Lounge and Bar. Your mind races, reeling at the pain, desperately stringing together the people you encountered and clues you gathered. 
Unable to stand, you lay, weak and weary on the frigid pavement. Your breaths begin to shallow and the ruby red fades to an abyssal black.//

//Not suspecting anyone or knowing where else to look on the premises, and with your reservation running at Checkpoint 16 running out, you left the hotel that night. You decided to investigate another location.//

<span class='lia'>It’s too bad your investigation came up short. People are hard to read. If you really want them to tell you anything, you’d have to talk more with them. Tell them what they want to hear to gain their trust. I guess that’s hard to do in one day…</span>

<span class='lia'>You proceeded with their investigation, yet everything came to a dead end. Your partner stayed missing for a few more weeks, until you and authorities agreed that she was most likely deceased. Though you continued to work as a detective, you missed the spark that was your partner Mira. After a few years of lonely, unnoteworthy solves, you retire in a quiet corner on Earth, always wondering where Mira went and what you could’ve done differently.</span>

The Office Worker insists on never even meeting Mira. Even if you suspect him, you just can’t figure out what’s missing, and you do not have much hard evidence. Forgivingly, he apologizes for his incompetence and wishes you well. He agrees to exchange contact information in case you for some reason have more questions for him in the future. You return back to your room. //

<span class='lia'>You suspect the Bellhop, huh? I expected nothing less from you.
I have a confession. I actually know where Mira is located. </span>

(if: $note1 is true)[<span class='lia'>That note you found in the bed… This was actually written by the Bellhop. He used it to lure his victim, Mira. It was planted in this very room and Mira followed it. She believed that it might’ve been related to the Cypher Diamond. </span>

]

<span class='lia'>Behind the Lounge & Bar stage, the Bellhop incapacitated her and kidnapped her. He needed to acquire a human soul to act as the AI in a robot he had made.
I know this because… 
I am Mira. 
I’m sorry for not saying it sooner. I didn’t have the heart to tell you I was here the whole time… I’m irreversibly trapped in this robot body, forever a helper at this hotel.
I couldn’t do anything to arouse his suspicion. He could power me off for good the instant he suspects me.
I know where he keeps my controller. Please discreetly alert the authorities and tell them what I’ve told you. 
We can stop the Bellhop before he causes any more harm.</span>

//Shortly after, you informed the police about the Bellhop. You told them everything that Mira said, from the kidnapping to the illegal bot creation. Checkpoint-Neutral security raided Checkpoint 16 that night and apprehended the Bellhop on the spot. They found damning evidence in the Bellhop’s quarters: He intended to abduct more people to power his machines. From what you were told, you were almost his next victim. He wanted to use the bots to minimize his workload, effectively decreasing his spending as a Bellhop while still getting paid. Later, he was tried for a litany of crimes and sentenced guilty to them all. Now, he remains imprisoned for life in a high-security prison under the supervision of the Barge.//

//It is far from a perfect outcome, but you were happy to see Mira again, even if she was in another form. After receiving a great payout due to the incurred damages, you and Mira continued to work together. Their involvement with Checkpoint 16 elevated their status and renown as a famed detective duo, solving all kinds of cases throughout the known galaxies and beyond.//

//You’ve spent many hours investigating and are needing another moment to circle back on what you’ve learned. You decide to grab some dinner at the Buffet again to gain some energy.

When you arrive at the Buffet, it is 8:05PM. You decide to try a vintage meal: steak and potatoes. At Checkpoint 16, they ramp up the dish into wagyu sirloin and truffle mashed potatoes. As you gorge yourself on the most decadent dinner you’ve ever had, you observe the Buffet once more. 

Just as you are about to get up and head back to your room, LIA suddenly speaks up.//

That’s where we came in.

Mira and I. We started the agency, built it from the ground up with just our heads on our shoulders and a (I say bargained, Mira prefers to say “stolen”) key to the cheapest permanent office we could find.

It’s been three weeks since Mira took off for the Cypher Diamond case. Largest natural sapphire/diamond found at the bottom of Europa VII’s ocean, stolen under the all-seeing eye of the Barge’s best law enforcement and military squads. She usually sprints home the second she’s done, I can’t imagine what’s keeping her.

That’s bad.

(Really, extremely, kind of bad.)

I looked into the logs. The only thing of note was a non-automated message from Checkpoint 16.

Checkpoint 16 is one of many rest-stops strewn across the galaxies where all sorts of people can find respite. 

Though, this one is definitely out of my comfort zone. An illustrious, opulent seven-star hotel that Mira would probably dream of for our future fifty-year anniversary vacation.

I already tried contacting every organization I could- no dice, since neither I nor the agency are “of great repute” (or rather, we’re totally unknown) to all Checkpoint-neutral associations. 

I’ll probably be in the red for the foreseeable future. I’ve got a two-way economy ticket and a one day, one night reservation at Checkpoint 16. 

I’ll have to do what I do best: uncover the truth using everything at my disposal

"Technology allowed us to reach beyond the stars. You can too”. A phrase repeated on every street, every colony and every planet. With interstellar travel a reality, humanity has explored, conquered and, quote-unquote, developed hundreds of cosmic civilizations.

Nevertheless, here are some jobs that robots and AI can’t replace, can’t replicate with enough humanity as people. For one, galactic peace hasn’t been easy- crime in the form of immorality and brutality exists in every corner of every galaxy and every empire.

An (text-colour:yellow)[individual] in a white dress shirt and slacks, typing on a personal device and eating some kind of mixed salad at the same time.

*You look around at the beautiful, mirrored hallway leading to rooms on each side. 

As you hover your palm over the door, the lock faintly glows as the door opens automatically. This room is leagues nicer than the motels and hostels you’ve stayed at with Mira before. 

In the corner is a closet with some sort of fancy, abstract painting. Leaned up against it is a large mirror that goes up to your shoulders. On the opposite end is a little desk with a consumable synthesizer and a single bed. The bathroom is right at the door- inside it is darker and smaller, but certainly not dirty. The room seems to be well-kept and thoroughly cleaned often.*
